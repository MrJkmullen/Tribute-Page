<ul>James Edward Harden, Jr. (born August 26, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Harden played college basketball for Arizona State, where he was named a consensus All-American and Pac-10 Player of the Year in 2009. Harden was selected with the third overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder.[1] In 2012, he was named NBA Sixth Man of the Year with the Thunder and helped the team reach the NBA Finals.

Harden was traded to Houston prior to the 2012–13 NBA season. Upon joining the Rockets, Harden became one of the NBA's most prolific scorers and earned recognition as the best shooting guard in the NBA,[2][3] as well as one of the top overall players in the league.[4] He has earned All-Star nods four times, and has earned All-NBA Team honors three times as well – once to the All-NBA third team (2013) and twice to the All-NBA first team (2014 and 2015). In 2015, Harden was awarded the first National Basketball Players Association MVP Award, being voted by his peers as the league's most valuable player.[5]

Harden is a two-time member of the United States national basketball team, winning gold medals in both the 2012 Summer Olympics and 2014 FIBA World Cup.</ul>

  <h3 class=text-center>College Career</h3>
  
<ul>Arizona State was picked to finish 9th in the Pac-10 Conference.[7] Due to the help of Harden's average of 17.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists, the Sun Devils went 21–13 (9–9) and finished tied for 5th in the Pac-10. They were considered a bubble team for the 2008 NCAA Tournament. Left out of the NCAA tournament, they were selected to the 2008 NIT field and defeated Alabama State and Southern Illinois before falling to defending national champion Florida.

After his freshman year, Harden was named first team All-Pac-10 and was named to the conference all-freshman team.[8] Harden was also named first team All-District by the NABC and the USBWA.

Entering his sophomore year, Harden appeared on many pre-season All-American lists and appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated college basketball preview issue. He was named to the Wooden Award preseason watch list.[9] On November 30, 2008, Harden scored a career-high 40 points in an 88–58 victory over UTEP.[10]

Harden finished his sophomore campaign with averages of 20.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game. He was named to the 2009 All-Pac 10 Tournament Team following Arizona State's defeat by USC at the Staples Center.[11] Following the conference season, Harden was named the Pacific-10 Conference's Player of the Year.[12] He was also named a consensus All-American. After the conclusion of the season (a second-round NCAA tournament loss to Syracuse), Harden declared for the 2009 NBA draft.[13] He employed Rob Pelinka as his agent.[14]

  <h3 class=text-center>NBA Player Profile</h3>
  <ul>Standing at 6 feet 5 inches tall (1.96 m) and weighing 220 pounds (100 kg), Harden plays mostly at the shooting guard position. With season averages of over 26 points per game since the 2012–13 season, Harden is considered one of the most versatile and dangerous scorers in the NBA.[71] He possesses a wide array of offensive moves; two of the most prominent among them being his Euro step[72] and his step-back jumper.[73] He has also gained notoriety for his ability to exploit league rules in order to more efficiently draw fouls and get to the free throw line, from which he is a career 84.9% shooter.[74][75] Though primarily a scorer, he is also known for his playmaking ability, orchestrating the Rockets' offense[76] with his elevated assist numbers. As of the 2014–15 season, he leads the league in assists that lead to three-point shots.[72][77]

While he has garnered acclaim for his prowess on the offensive end, Harden has built a reputation as a poor defender. Criticism of his defense intensified in early 2014, when a video titled "James Harden: Defensive Juggernaut" featuring eleven minutes worth of clips of Harden conceding field goals, was circulated on the Internet.[78] During the 2014 offseason, he committed to an improvement on defense, which manifested as early as August of that year as a member of the United States men's national basketball team.[79] His improved defense carried over to the following season, and has been cited as a major reason for the Rockets' regular season success.[80]
